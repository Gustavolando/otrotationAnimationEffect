## Rotation Animation Effect

Believe or not, this is the most amazing CSS and HTML exercise I coded a while ago.  It was so awesome for me that I decided learning more of CSS effects.

An elegant, smooth and hypnotic CSS effect.

I practiced here a lot of rotations, animations, gradients,shadows, borders, 3D perspective and a delightful styled design composition.

Colorful HTML and CSS only code.
