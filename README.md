## Rotation Animation Effect

Believe or not, this is the most transcendental CSS and HTML exercise that I ever coded. It was so awesome for me that I fall in love of CSS and decided to learn all I can of CSS effects.

An elegant, smooth and hypnotic CSS effect.

I practiced here a lot of rotations, animations, gradients, shadows, borders, 3D perspective and a delightful styled design composition.

A pretty nice HTML and CSS only code.
